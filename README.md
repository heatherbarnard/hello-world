# hello-world

My Name is Heather. I have a dual bachelors degree in Urban Planning and in GIS and now so close to having my masters in GIS. 
I have three kids, ages 7,6, and 4 and two dogs. 
I was in the Army for 4 years as a Geospatial engineer, and then a year as a GIS Intern at EPCOR, and now at APS. 
With the free time I have, I like to hike and swim and spend time outdoors. 
90's country and Christian music is my favorite.
